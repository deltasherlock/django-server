# DeltaSherlock Django Server
A Django implementation of the fingerprint analyzation API

## A Note on Repo Organization
This repository contains the DeltaSherlock **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) server**. If you're looking for the **utility package**, head over to [utility-package](https://github.com/deltasherlock/utility-package/) The entirety of the Django server can be found in the `django-server` directory, and that directory is structured in [typical Django project fashion](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project).
